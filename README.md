SMB1 Level Corruptor
====================

The prototype for Level-Headed! Randomizes level objects and enemies in Super Mario Bros. 1 on the NES.

-=========================- About SMB1 Level Corruptor -=========================-

Wow, look at what I found! It's the prototype code for Level-Headed! The first
Level-Headed prototype was written in C#, but I decided to port it to C++
later on. This is what became of the result of that effort.

Since I found this code again, I decided to revamp the GUI to allow users to
use the unused functions of the Level-Headed. These functions are interesting,
but they don't create the most interesting or well designed levels. In fact,
they can create scenarios that are impossible to complete. With this in mind,
I never plan on releasing this with any part of Level-Headed. It has become
its own separate entity.

In order to use this, you will need to provide the following unmodified NES ROM:

"Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes"

Make a backup of this ROM before using this application! SMB1 ROM Corruptor will
hack the supplied file!

If you wish to contact me about the application, or anything of the like,

-==================================- FAQ -==================================-

Q: What is this?

A: This is a level corruptor for Super Mario Bros. 1 on the NES. It originally acted
   as a prototype for what is now known as Level-Headed. Before writing Level-Headed,
   I wanted to be sure that my idea was feasible and, most importantly, I wanted to
   make sure that I could do it.

Q: Why are you releasing this?

A: This prototype contains two functions which will not be included in Level-Headed.
   These are "Randomize Level Objects" and "Randomize Enemy Objects". These will never
   see the light of day in Level-Headed, since they tend to create scenarios that are
   often impossible to complete. However, what SMB1 Level Corruptor generates can
   actually be somewhat entertaining. It's like playing a corrupted ROM -- except it
   doesn't crash.

Q: Why is your code so bad?

A: Keep in mind that this is a prototype. I was never planning on turning this code
   into Level-Headed itself. It was simply a place for me to try my ideas out and see
   how difficult it would be to randomly generate levels in Super Mario Bros. 1 once
   I had decompiled the game. This is why there is not much error checking and the code
   is a mess. The ultimate goal of this prototype was to mess with the level objects
   and enemies without causing the game to crash.
   
Q: Can you add X into SMB1 Level Corruptor?

A: I do not plan on supporting this application in any way. I'm simply releasing
   it for the curious. Anyone is free to do anything with the code of SMB1 Level
   Corruptor as long as they abide the GPLv2 license.

Q: Where can I download a copy?

A: You can download the Windows version here:
